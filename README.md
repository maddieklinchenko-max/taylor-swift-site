# Taylor Fan Site (Bootstrap Starter)

This is a small, fan-made static website scaffold using Bootstrap for a simple and responsive layout.

Files:
- `index.html` — main page (Bootstrap CDN used)
- `styles.css` — small custom styles
- `script.js` — demo form handler and gallery preview

Quick local preview (Windows PowerShell):

# Using Python (if installed)
python -m http.server 8000
# Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser

# Or using npm 'serve' (if you have Node.js):
npm install -g serve; serve .

Deploy options:
- GitHub Pages: push this repo to GitHub and enable Pages from the `main` branch (or use /docs folder).
- Vercel: connect the repo and deploy (no build step required).

Notes:
- Do not publish copyrighted song lyrics or unlicensed images. Link to official streaming and media pages for music and photos.
- If you'd like, I can add a Spotify embed, improve the gallery with a lightbox, or switch to a Tailwind-based design.
