Drop album cover images here and name them exactly as below to have the album cards display:

- album1.jpg  -> first album card
- album2.jpg  -> second album card
- album3.jpg  -> third album card

Guidance & copyright:
- Album covers are usually copyrighted. Only add images you have the right to use.
- If you want to use official covers, you can link to official streaming pages or embed Spotify/YouTube content instead.

Example PowerShell (run where your downloaded images are):
Move-Item .\CoverFile1.jpg C:\Users\maddi\taylor-swift-code\images\albums\album1.jpg
Move-Item .\CoverFile2.jpg C:\Users\maddi\taylor-swift-code\images\albums\album2.jpg
Move-Item .\CoverFile3.jpg C:\Users\maddi\taylor-swift-code\images\albums\album3.jpg

Refresh the page (or re-open index.html) to see the covers.
